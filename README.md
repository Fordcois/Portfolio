## Personal Portfolio Site

Welcome to my personal portfolio site, showcasing a range of my projects. Designed with a mobile-first approach, this site is highly responsive, utilizing multiple breakpoints and media queries to ensure an optimal viewing experience on any device. 

Additionally, the site is structured to be easily updatable, allowing for seamless additions of new projects and content.
