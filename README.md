## Personal Portfolio Site

Welcome to my personal portfolio site, showcasing a range of my projects. Built in NextJS and designed with a mobile-first approach, the site is responsive, utilizing multiple breakpoints and media queries to ensure an optimal viewing experiences across devices.

Additionally, the site is structured to be easily updatable, allowing for seamless additions of new projects and content.
